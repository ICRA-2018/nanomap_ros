    "Key features of NanoMap include:\n",
    "- Incorporates frame-specific uncertainty (due to modeled local pose uncertainty) returned along with query point\n",
    "- Query algorithm returns k-nearest-neighbors from most recent view of query point\n",
    "- Updates pose history information 2-4 orders of magnitude faster than fusion-based voxel packages\n",
    "- Particularly fast for low amounts of queries (<10,000)\n",

    "\n",
    "NanoMap is particularly fast for low amounts of motion planning queries (< ~10,000), due to its low data structure build time.  Fusion-based voxel structures take longer to build but have faster query times, causing them to be faster for > ~10,000 queries.\n",
